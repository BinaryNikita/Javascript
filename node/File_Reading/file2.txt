Step 1: What is Node.js?
Explanation:
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside a browser. It uses the V8 engine (Googleâ€™s JavaScript engine) to execute code, which makes it fast and efficient.

Think of Node.js as:

A tool to build backend (server-side) applications.
A way to handle multiple tasks asynchronously without waiting for one to finish.
Real-World Use Cases:
Web servers (e.g., powering APIs for Netflix or LinkedIn)
Real-time applications (e.g., chat apps like WhatsApp Web)
Command-line tools (e.g., npm CLI)
